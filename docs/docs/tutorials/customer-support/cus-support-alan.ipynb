    "# Build a Customer Support Bot\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer support bots can free up teams' time by handling routine issues, but it can be hard to build a bot that reliably handles diverse tasks in a way that doesn't leave the user pulling their hair out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will build a customer support bot for an airline to help users research and make travel arrangements. You'll learn to use LangGraph's interrupts and checkpointers and more complex state to organize your assistant's tools and manage a user's flight bookings, hotel reservations, car rentals, and excursions. It assumes you are familiar with the concepts presented in the [LangGraph introductory tutorial](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/).\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have built a working bot and gained an understanding of  LangGraph's key concepts and architectures. You'll be able to apply these design patterns to your other AI projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final chat bot will look something like the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/part-4-diagram.png\" src=\"../img/part-4-diagram.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "First, set up your environment. We'll install this tutorial's prerequisites, download the test DB, and define the tools we will reuse in each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using Claude as our LLM and define a number of custom tools. While most of our tools will connect to a local sqlite database (and require no additional dependencies), we will also provide a general web search to the agent using Tavily."

    "1. The assistant booked a car when we were focusing on lodging, then had to cancel and rebook later on: oops! The user should have final say before booking to avoid unwanted feeds.\n",
    "2. The assistant struggled to search for recommendations. We could improve this by adding more verbose instructions and examples using the tool, but doing this for every tool can lead to a large prompt and overwhelmed agent.\n",
    "3. The assistant had to do an explicit search just to get the user's relevant information. We can save a lot of time by fetching the user's relevant travel details immediately so the assistant can directly respond.\n",

      "\n",
      "I should also check if there are any delays or changes in the flight status. Since the scheduled departure is in four minutes and the current time is 06:26, I don't see any indication of a delay, but it's always good to mention that they should check for updates.\n",

The user can then start it up at any time by running it with the right config.\n",

Note [from this trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/a077f4be-6baa-4e97-89f7-0dabc65c0fd0/r) that you typically **resume** a flow by invoking the graph with `(None, config)`.

      "\n",
      "First, I need to figure out what exactly the user is looking for. They want to know the departure time of their flight. Looking at the data they provided, there's a 'scheduled_departure' field with a timestamp. That should be the answer, but I should make sure I'm interpreting it correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scheduled departure time given is '2025-04-27 06:35:09.545822-04:00'. The date part is April 27, 2025, which matches the current date they've specified as 2025-04-27. The time is 06:35:09 in the -04:00 timezone, which is UTC-4. I should convert this to a more readable format for the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the current time is 06:31:16.627446, just a few minutes before the scheduled departure, the flight is about to take off. I should mention that the flight is almost ready for boarding to provide a complete picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also notice the flight details: it's LX0112 from CDG to BSL, with a seat in Economy class. This context might help if the user has further questions, but for now, the main focus is the departure time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should present the information clearly, making sure the time is easy to understand. Maybe I can format it without the milliseconds and timezone offset, just the date and time in a friendly way.\n",
      "\n",

    "## Part 4: Specialized Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we saw how \"wide\" chat-bots, relying on a single prompt and LLM to handle various user intents, can get us far. However, it's difficult to create **predictably great** user experiences for known intents with this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, your graph can detect userintent and select the appropriate workflow or \"skill\" to satisfy the user's needs. Each workflow can focus on its domain, allowing for isolated improvements without degrading the overall assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll split user experiences into separate sub-graphs, resulting in a structure like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/part-4-diagram.png\" src=\"../img/part-4-diagram.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, each square wraps an agentic, focused workflow. The primary assistant fields the user's initial queries, and the graph routes to the appropriate \"expert\" based on the query content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to keep track of which sub-graph is in control at any given moment. While we _could_ do this through some arithmetic on the message list, it's easier to track as a dedicated **stack**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Add a `dialog_state` list to the `State` below. Any time a `node` is run and returns a value for `dialog_state`, the `update_dialog_stack` function will be called to determine how to apply the update."

It departs from CDG, which is Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, and arrives at BSL, which I believe is Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg Airport in Switzerland. The scheduled departure time is 2025-04-27 at 06:39:27.357218-04:00, and arrival is at 08:09:27.357218-04:00. The seat is 18E, and it's an Economy fare.\n",

    "\n",
    "You've now developed a customer support bot that handles diverse tasks using focused workflows.\n",
    "More importantly, you've learned to use some of LangGraph's core features to design and refactor an application based on your product needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above examples are by no means optimized for your unique needs - LLMs make mistakes, and each flow can be made more reliable through better prompts and experimentation. Once you've created your initial support bot, the next step would be to start [adding evaluations](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation) so you can confidently improve your system. Check out those docs and our other tutorials to learn more!"
